#### Choose Region

Use one Region for the whole project, for example:

```text
ap-southeast-1
```

Using one Region makes it easier for Lambda to call S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Bedrock, Polly, and Transcribe without configuration drift.

#### Create AWS Budget

1. Open **Billing and Cost Management**.
