#### Components to create

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| User Pool | Stores user accounts. |
| App Client | Allows the React frontend to use Cognito Hosted UI. |
| Hosted UI | Cognito-managed sign-in/sign-up pages. |
| Groups | Provides user and admin roles. |
| Callback URL | Frontend URL after successful sign-in. |

After completion, the frontend can redirect users to Hosted UI and receive tokens after sign-in.
