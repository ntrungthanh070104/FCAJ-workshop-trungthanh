4. Create integrations to each Lambda.
5. Create routes from the table in section `5.7`.
6. Create a stage, for example:

```text
default
```

7. Copy the invoke URL for the frontend.

#### Example deployed endpoint

```text
https://<api-id>.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/default/upload_cv
```

#### Route checks

* Each route points to the correct Lambda.
* Lambda permission allows API Gateway to invoke the function.
* Stage is deployed or auto deploy is enabled.
