#### Deploy `polly_speech`

```text
backend/polly_speech/lambda_function.py
```

![Cognito flow](/FCAJ-workshop-trungthanh/images/5-Workshop/service-image/1.563.png)
Environment variables:

![Cognito flow](/FCAJ-workshop-trungthanh/images/5-Workshop/service-image/2.563.png)

IAM needs `polly:SynthesizeSpeech`, `s3:PutObject`.

#### Deploy `transcribe_audio`

```text
backend/transcribe_audio/lambda_function.py
```
![Cognito flow](/FCAJ-workshop-trungthanh/images/5-Workshop/service-image/3.563.png)
Environment variables:

![Cognito flow](/FCAJ-workshop-trungthanh/images/5-Workshop/service-image/4.563.png)

IAM needs `transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob`, `transcribe:GetTranscriptionJob`, `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`.

#### Deploy `admin_api`

```text
backend/admin_api/lambda_function.py
```
![Cognito flow](/FCAJ-workshop-trungthanh/images/5-Workshop/service-image/5.563.png)
Admin API needs matching read/write permissions on `Users`, `CVs`, and `Interviews`. If it blocks users with Cognito, the Lambda role also needs permissions such as `cognito-idp:AdminDisableUser` and `cognito-idp:AdminEnableUser`.
